Planning Doc:

To do:

1) Organize data sets
2) Convert Data sets to classifications
3) Generate EDA Notebook 
4) Build benchmark models for each data set & dummy models
5) Build complex models
6) Error analysis
7) Model comparison 


Pipeline:

Cleaning Script (load data, set classification columns)
EDA Notebook (not included in modeling pipeline)
Featuriziation script (or should this be included with the models?) 
Generate & fit models for each data set 
Score models & record time to train -> store output in CSV?
