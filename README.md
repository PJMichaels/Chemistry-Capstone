# Chemistry-Capstone

Contributers:
Philip Michaels and David Dunstan

Summary: 
This is a capstone project for the University of Michigan Masters in Applied Data Science program. The goal of this project is to produce a browser hosted user-interface, which allows users to evaluate the drug-like properties of chemical entities. Provided values will be made available through a multitude of machine learning models, and possibly known data sources. As a part of this project we aim to allows end users to view the trade-offs of different types of ML approaches for the same prediction tasks, and the associated uncertainty in those predictions. More details to come as this project evolves...
