Next steps:
1) Develop code to split data:
    Might as well clean the data at this point too - remove any that fail converstion to mol/fp
    Random Split (set seed and split to train/test & val)
    Second split - cluster based - perform a KNN clustering then iterate through clusters and add to the sets 
        Scaffold based Chemprop (https://chemprop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_modules/chemprop/data/scaffold.html)
2) Build Exploratory data analysis notebook, check class balances, visualize chemical space & clusters, 
3)Add code for hyperparamter optimization for the various simple models
4) Train the chem prop models on the post-split data.
