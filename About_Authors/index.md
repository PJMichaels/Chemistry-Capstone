## Inspiration:
This project is a culmination of the University of Michigan Masters in Applied Data Science program. Both Phil Michaels and David Dunstan have worked in the pharmaceutical industry for over 10 years with backgrounds in analytical chemistry, small molecule purification, High-throughput synthesis and automation. The authors have pursued this Master's program to help better bridge data science with the laboratory work used to generate the data and advance the field of drug discovery.
