How to add a new dataset or trained model file to dvc repo/versioning.
**** Important, you need to add this file to dvc before git ****
**** this first step tells git to ignore the large file(s), and ****
**** adds some additional file which will get tracked in git/github!!!

$ dvc add data\<file_to_track.csv> 
$ git commit data/data.xml.dvc -m "Dataset update notes"
$ dvc push

Once a dataset is added to dvc git commit will track file changes
and dvc push will update/version files in dvc repo. These are easily
fetched with dvc pull

$ git commit -m "<change notes here>" -a
$ dvc push
$ git push origin main
