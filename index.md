# Welcome to the Chemistry Capstone Project:

## Introduction: 

In modeling, users are regularly faced with how to chose between different model types. The general heuristic of selecting the simplest model appropriate for a given task is good, however how does one know what will work best? In the field of drug discovery, advances in automation and high-throughput screening and laboratory techniques have enabled unprecedented creation of datasets. These datasets have fueled a renewed interest and application of data science techniques to understand and extract value. In this project we aim to explore and compare cutting edge models to those that are popular historically. To achive this, we train and evaluate several models against a series of relevant drug discovery datasets. We then take an in-depth look at the model performance for a dataset of compounds for potential alczheimer's treatment. 

### If you are new to chemistry please consider exploring our [Cheminformatics Introduction](Chemistry_Intro/index.md).

## Code:

All of the code is available in the linked Git-hub repository. We have included both a set of notebooks that provide visualization and a quick way to explore the results, as well as a end-to-end pipeline which will provide facile duplication of this work. We hope that this pipeline will be of use and can be expanded to include additional featurization, models and datasets in the future. <br><br>

We have also provided a brief [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VzaYKBJP9WgfkLmqmSXuuMPifh6q9_iX/view?usp=sharing) overview and Q&A on this pipeline to help users get started.
