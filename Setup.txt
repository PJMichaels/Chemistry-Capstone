Connecting to remote repos and getting your local project setup!

1. Make sure dependencies are installed
    - install git
    - install/configure Gdrive for desktop. Make sure you can navigate to this in your terminal.
      It should be possible by entering "G:" in your terminal.
    - pip install dvc in whatever env is being used by your terminal
    - I recommend using VS code as an IDE with DVC, Jupyter, YAML, and Python extensions installed

2. Navigate in your terminal to where you want your Chemistry_Capstone project to exist and enter the
   following cmd:    git clone https://github.com/PJMichaels/Chemistry-Capstone.git
   If successful you should see all contents present in GitHub repo in your local repo
   
3. I would recommend opening VS code, using the Open Folder command to load your Chemistry_Capstone
   folder, and continuing this tutorial from there.
   
Status Check: At this point, you should have all the GitHub repo, including the .dvc directory, and the
              .dvcignore file. This is important because datasets and trained models for this project do
              not exist in GitHub, but instead exist in a remote repo in google drive. We need to configure
              the dvc remote repo, dvc_origin, to be able to pull/push these files to and from our local repo.
              
4. Assuming the reader of this has access to the Gdrive repo, navigate to the dvc repo folder in your shared
   Gdrive folder and get the repo path. It might look something like this: G:\Shared Drives\Chemistry Capstone
   In your local project folder, open the .dvc\config file, and edit the url path to reflect the path you just
   retrieved. The contents of this folder should look something like this (disregarding indents for formatting
   of this README.md file):
   
   [core]
       remote = dvc_origin
   ['remote "dvc_origin"']
       url = G:\Shared Drives\Chemistry Capstone\Datasets\DVC_Repo
       
5. Now that your Gdrive is linked, and dvc remote config is pointing to the right repo folder, enter in your
   command line: dvc pull
   
6. All datasets and associated trained models (anything very large which should be stored in Gdrive) should now
   exist in your local repo. At this point you can start coding!
