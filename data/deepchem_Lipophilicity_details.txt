Function Dataset description:

 Lipophilicity is an important feature of drug molecules that affects both
  membrane permeability and solubility. The lipophilicity dataset, curated
  from ChEMBL database, provides experimental results of octanol/water
  distribution coefficient (logD at pH 7.4) of 4200 compounds.
  Scaffold splitting is recommended for this dataset.
  The raw data csv file contains columns below:
  - "smiles" - SMILES representation of the molecular structure
  - "exp" - Measured octanol/water distribution coefficient (logD) of the
    compound, used as label
