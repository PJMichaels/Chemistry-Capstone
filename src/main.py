### Project main.py file should be run to execute on final project

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Hello World!")


### this could be a function that allows us to iterate over model paramteres by writing
### and re-writing the yaml params file... or it is useless... tbd

### if it is something like that it would be good to import and note how long the whole
### thing takes to run and what the PC system specs were for this run
